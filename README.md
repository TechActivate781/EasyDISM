# EasyDISM
Deploy and read WIMs/ESDs using this easy-to-use tool, made using DISM and C.
EasyDISM is based on DISM. DISM is a Microsoft product, all rights reserved.

# Features
Currently, only the following features are supported:
- Applying a Windows image
- Making an applied Windows Image bootable
- Getting information from a Windows image

The app requires Windows 8.1 to run (although it should run on build 9477 or 9471); commands were changed in the one of the aforementioned builds

# Usage
To use the app, launch the .exe file with Administrator privileges. 

# Future updates
Version 0.9 should add support for Windows 7/8, while version 1.0 should have a GUI.
After the GUI version is released, CLI builds will still be offered, but they will only be released when a new feature is added.
